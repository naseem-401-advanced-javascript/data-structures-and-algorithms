## Code Challenge 04: Mock Interviews

## Challenge Description
* It asks you to write a function that takes an array of arrays and return the summation of these inside arrays.

* also the challenge ask you to do Fibonacci sequence which is a set of numbers that starts with a one or a zero, followed by a one, and proceeds based on the rule that each number (called a Fibonacci number) is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

## Approach & Efficiency
* We first wrote a function named `sumMatrix()` that will give the summation of any matrix(array of arrays) you pass to it .

* The second function named `fibSeq()` will give you the number of any positive or negative index that you oass to it.
