# Multi Bracket Validation

## Challenge

* Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

* Round Brackets : ()
* Square Brackets : []
* Curly Brackets : {}

## Approach & Efficiency

Create a function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced.


## Big O:
This solution has a Big O notation efficiency of O(n) for time and space.
