# Trees
## Challenge
* Building a basic tree class, binary tree, and binary search tree
## Approach & Efficiency
* The methods of this class takes big O(n), since it has to read every node in the tree
## API
### BT class
* `preOrder()` : it pushes the values of each node to an array based on DLR (data, left, right)
* `inOrder()` : it pushes the valuse based on LDR
* `postOrder()` : it pushes the valuse based on LRD
### BST class
- `add()` : it adds to a binary search tree weather it is an empty one or not.
