# Queues With Stacks

### Feature Tasks
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

- enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
- dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.


### Approach & Efficiency 
Enqueue O(1)
When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.
Dequeue O(1)
When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

### Testing

- It should successfully enqueue items
- It sould successfully dequeue and item
- It should succesfully dequeue all items
