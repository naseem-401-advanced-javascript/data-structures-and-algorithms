# Challenge Summary
This challenge makes you more familiar with linkedLists and how to do methods on them

## Challenge Description
The challenge asks you to create a method inside your linked list class named `kthFromEnd()` which will count based on the passed value from the end of the linked list and give you back the value of the node where the counter stops, if the the value is negative or out of range will return `exception`

## Approach & Efficiency
The Big O notation defines an upper bound of an algorithm, it bounds a function only from above. For example, consider the case of Insertion Sort. It takes linear time in best case and quadratic time in worst case

## Big O:
kthFromEnd:O(1)
